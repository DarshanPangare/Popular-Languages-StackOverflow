# Popular-Languages-StackOverflow
Every year Stack Overflow releases results of a survey it conducts amongst it's users. I have written a basic Py3 program using the matplotlib and NumPy libraries to plot a graph refrencing the 'Top 5 Popular Programming Languages of 2019' amongst the StackOverflow users. The graph shows the popularity in % voted by 65,000 users.
